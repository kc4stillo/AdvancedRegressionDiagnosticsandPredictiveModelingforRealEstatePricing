# Advanced Regression Diagnostics and Predictive Modeling for Real Estate Pricing

## Project Overview
This project, created by **Kyle Castillo** for the course **i306 Statistics for Informatics**, focuses on advanced regression diagnostics and predictive modeling to analyze and predict real estate prices. The analysis utilizes key factors such as property size, location, and quality to develop a robust regression model. Comprehensive diagnostics are conducted to assess the performance and accuracy of the model.

## Key Features
- **Predictive Model Development**: A regression model designed to predict housing prices based on multiple independent variables (such as location, square footage, and build quality).
- **Regression Diagnostics**: Detailed diagnostics including residual analysis, multicollinearity checks, and influential observation detection.
- **Data Exploration and Visualization**: In-depth data exploration and visualizations to understand the relationships between the variables and their impact on housing prices.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using performance metrics such as R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to evaluate model accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- **R**: For statistical analysis and model development.
- **ggplot2**: To create visualizations and explore data trends.
- **R Markdown**: For documentation and presentation of the analysis.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the R Markdown file in RStudio.
3. Run the entire script to generate the analysis and diagnostics report.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for modeling.
- `code/`: R scripts for data cleaning, modeling, and diagnostics.
- `output/`: Generated graphs, reports, and model performance metrics.
