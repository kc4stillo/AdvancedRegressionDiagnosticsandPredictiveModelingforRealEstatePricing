# Advanced Regression Diagnostics and Predictive Modeling for Real Estate Pricing

## Project Overview
This project focuses on advanced regression diagnostics and predictive modeling to analyze and predict real estate prices. The analysis utilizes key factors such as property size, location, and quality to develop a robust regression model. Comprehensive diagnostics are conducted to assess the performance and accuracy of the model.

## Key Features
- **Predictive Model Development**: A regression model designed to predict housing prices based on multiple independent variables (such as location, square footage, and build quality).
- **Regression Diagnostics**: Detailed diagnostics including residual analysis, multicollinearity checks, and influential observation detection.
- **Data Exploration and Visualization**: In-depth data exploration and visualizations to understand the relationships between the variables and their impact on housing prices.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using performance metrics such as R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to evaluate model accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- **R**: For statistical analysis and model development.
- **ggplot2**: To create visualizations and explore data trends.
- **R Markdown**: For documentation and presentation of the analysis.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the Quarto file in RStudio.
3. Render the entire script to generate the analysis and diagnostics report in a browser.
